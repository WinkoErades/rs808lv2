I want you to create a functional  software synth based on the famous Roland 808. And add MIDI functionality to it. Add a dual mono-out to it. And I want a mono output per instrument. The software synth should run on Ubuntu Studio 25.10, meaning audio out and MIDI-in should be pipewire, jack, or ALSA. I want rotary knobs that can be addressed via MIDI CC instructions. For assiging the rotary knobs, I want an auto learn function per knob. Please remove the sequencer part of the Roland 808, as MIDI signals will come via a DAW or MIDI instrument. Also, create a clean parameter/port naming schema for LV2 (URIs, symbols, ranges), a default MIDI note map (808 vs GM) table, and a UI wireframe list (exact knobs per voice + which ones get MIDI learn by default). Also provide a complete LV2 manifest-style port list (all ports with indices, symbols, and default values).
The workings of each instrument can be used from a working SuperCollider sketch that I will upload. Always create the complete code. Never use pseudo code. Never let the user extend code. Be complete. Explain to the user exactly which files to create, the structure of the files, and the way to create/compile the software.

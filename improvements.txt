There are a few things that don't work as expected.

Alright, the synth seems to be working (it makes sounds), but some instruments or sounds of the synth are soft and some are loud, so their volume is not consistent.



Alright, the synth seems to be working (it makes sounds), now I want knobs added.

Global:
- Master Level
- Global Accent Amount

Instruments:
BD: Level, Tune, Decay, Attack/Click
SD: Level, Tune, Decay, Tone, Snappy
LT: Level, Tune, Decay
MTT: Level, Tune, Decay
HT: Level, Tune, Decay
CH: Level, Tone, Decay
OH: Level, Tone, Decay
Clap: Level, Tone, Decay
Cowbell: Level, Tune, Decay, Tone
Cymbal: Level, Tone, Decay
Rimshot: Level, Tone
Maracas: Level, Tone
Claves: Level
Rimshot: Level


Every knob can be controlled by a CC assignment:
Each knob has:
CC number (0–127 or “None”)
MIDI channel (Global / Omni / specific 1–16)
Range scaling (min/max, or “normal”)
Pickup mode: Soft takeover

UI behavior:
Right-clicking a knob will set it in “Learn” mode.
When Learn is active for that knob:
The next received MIDI CC becomes its assignment (CC#, channel).
Provide feedback: “Assigned CC74 Ch1” etc.
Also, provide Right-click/context menu: Learn / Unlearn / Set CC manually.

Conflict rules:
If the CC is already assigned to another knob:
Either allow duplicates (advanced users) or
Prompt: “Reassign from X to Y?”
Recommended: allow duplicates but show a warning icon.

Persistence:
CC assignments are saved with a preset and, optionally a “Global mapping” file for hardware controllers.

MIDI CC smoothing/stepping:
Implement parameter smoothing so rapid CC changes don’t zipper ~5–20 ms smoothing time (configurable).

Rotary knobs:
All continuous parameters use rotary knobs.
Knob tooltip shows:
Parameter name
Current value
CC assignment (if any)
